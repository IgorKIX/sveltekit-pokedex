# sveltekit-pokedex

My first meeting with the SvelteKit. I'm still impressed & bewitched by the Svelte! I love how it combines the ideas known to me from React and Angular. This project is a "copy" of pokedex known to all from the Pokemon anime television series. This application offers countless possibilities for interactive use by the user. For example, you can click on a pokemon card and go to the detail pages! or search the list of pokemon for your favorite ones (The list contains 150 creatures - just pure old school). It's based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU7MgYIbtAk).
